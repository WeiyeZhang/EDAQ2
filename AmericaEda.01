library(lubridate)

library(plyr)


CovidData<- import("tidycovid19.csv", setclass="tibble")
CovidData$date = as.Date(parse_date_time(CovidData$date,orders=c("y","ym","ymd")))
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
firstdiff <- function(x) {

  result = x-shifted
  which_negative = which(result<0)

CovidData <- mutate(CovidData, daily_confirmed = firstdiff(confirmed))
CovidData <- mutate(CovidData, daily_deaths = firstdiff(deaths))


```

Selecting two countries in North America, Canada and Mexico, and two countries in South America: Argentina and Brazil. We choose the baseline date as 2020-02-06.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
BrazilDataPostMar1 <- {CovidData %>% 
    filter ((str_detect(country, "Brazil")) & (date > as.Date("2020-02-06")))}
ArgentinaDataPostMar1 <- {CovidData %>% 
    filter ((str_detect(country, "Argentina")) & (date > as.Date("2020-02-06")))}
CanadaDataPostMar1 <- {CovidData %>% 
    filter ((str_detect(country, "Canada")) & (date > as.Date("2020-02-06")))}
MexicoDataPostMar1 <- {CovidData %>% 
    filter ((str_detect(country, "Mexico")) & (date > as.Date("2020-02-06")))}
```

Then we extract all the variables from our variables list to our data frame.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
Brazil <- {BrazilDataPostMar1%>% 
    filter(country == "Brazil") %>%
    select(country,date, daily_confirmed,daily_deaths, soc_dist,mov_rest,pub_health,lockdown,gov_soc_econ,apple_mtr_driving,gcmr_retail_recreation,gcmr_workplaces,gcmr_residential, gcmr_workplaces,gtrends_score,gcmr_grocery_pharmacy) }

Mexico <-{MexicoDataPostMar1%>% 
    select(country,date, daily_confirmed,daily_deaths, soc_dist,mov_rest,pub_health,lockdown,gov_soc_econ,apple_mtr_driving,gcmr_retail_recreation,gcmr_workplaces,gcmr_residential, gcmr_workplaces,gtrends_score,gcmr_grocery_pharmacy) }

Canada<-{CanadaDataPostMar1 %>% 
    select(country,date, daily_confirmed,daily_deaths, soc_dist,mov_rest,pub_health,lockdown,gov_soc_econ,apple_mtr_driving,gcmr_retail_recreation,gcmr_workplaces,gcmr_residential, gcmr_workplaces,gtrends_score, gcmr_grocery_pharmacy) }

Argentina<-{ArgentinaDataPostMar1 %>% 
    select(country,date, daily_confirmed,daily_deaths, soc_dist,mov_rest,pub_health,lockdown,gov_soc_econ,apple_mtr_driving,gcmr_retail_recreation,gcmr_workplaces,gcmr_residential, gcmr_workplaces,gtrends_score,gcmr_grocery_pharmacy) }

country<-c("Brazil","Mexico","Canada","Argentina")
Americadata<-rbind.fill(Argentina,Brazil,Canada,Mexico)
```

## Overview

Let's have a general overview on four chosen coutries.
1.Daily confirmed cases in the whole period in different countries.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Americaconfirmed<-{Americadata%>%ggplot(aes(x=date,y=daily_confirmed,color=country))}+labs(x="Date",y="Number of lockdowm measures",title = "Daily confirmed in four chosen countries.")+geom_point()+scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")
print(Americaconfirmed)
```
2.Relationship between 
```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Americarecreation <- {Americadata %>% ggplot(aes(x=lockdown,y=gcmr_retail_recreation,color=country))}+geom_point()+labs(x="Number of lockdown measures", y="Activity change in recreation ",title = "Relationship between number of lockdown measures and activity change in recreation")+scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")
    
print(Americarecreation)
```

3.We compare the relationship between the number of social distancing measures and the frequency that people visit retail and recreation places in different countries.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = Americadata, aes(x=soc_dist,y=gcmr_retail_recreation))+geom_jitter(aes(color=country))+labs(x="Number of social distancing measures",y="Activity change in recreation")
```

## Change in Activity in retail and recreation places.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
plotretail.date <- ggplot(data=Americadata,aes(x = date, y =gcmr_retail_recreation, color=country)) + geom_point()+labs(x="Date" ,y="Activity in retail and recreation places %change from baseline" ,title = "Change in activity in retail and recreation places")+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 weeks", date_labels = "%d/%m")
print(plotretail.date)

```

The graph indicates that there was a sharp decrease in activity in retail and recreation places for every country.

For Brazil, Sao Paulo government introduced "lockdown" measures in 24 March 2020, retail and recreation places activity decreased approximately linearly by 50%, then slowly increased from the beginning of May. There is also a clear difference between weekdays and weekends: residential activity at weekends is lower than during weekdays.
### Brazil

1. Activity change in retail and recreation in Brazil with observations of number of lockdown measures in Brazil.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Bre<-ggplot(Brazil, aes(y=Brazil$gcmr_retail_recreation, x=date,color=Brazil$lockdown)) +geom_point()+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months", date_labels = "%b-%y")+labs("retail recreation/lockdown")
Bgro<-ggplot(Brazil, aes(y=Brazil$gcmr_grocery_pharmacy, x=date,color=Brazil$lockdown)) +geom_point()+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months", date_labels = "%b-%y")+labs("grocery pharmacy/lockdown")
Bdriving<-ggplot(Brazil, aes(y=Brazil$apple_mtr_driving,x=date, color=Brazil$lockdown))+geom_point()+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months", date_labels = "%b-%y")+labs(title = "driving/lockdown")

grid.arrange(Bre,Bgro,Bdriving)
```

2.Relationship between Number of public health measures and the frequency that people visit retail and recreation places in Brazil.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(Brazil, aes(x=pub_health, y=gcmr_retail_recreation)) +  geom_point()+labs(x="Number of public health measures",y="Activity in recreation (% change from baseline)",title ="Relationship between Number of public health measures and the frequency that people visit recreation places",subtitle =" Drawn from Google Community Mobility Reports")
```

3. apple_mtr_driving and soc_dist

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Bdriving.soc<-ggplot(Brazil, aes(y=apple_mtr_driving, x=soc_dist)) +geom_point()+labs(x="Number of social distancing measures",y="Apple Maps usage for driving directions(% change from baseline)",title = "Relationship between maps usage for driving and the number of social distancing measures in Brazil.",subtitle = "Drawn from Apple Maps Usage")

Bdriving.date.soc<-ggplot(Brazil, aes(y=apple_mtr_driving,x=date, color=soc_dist)) +geom_point()+labs(x="date",y="Apple Maps usage for driving directions(% change from baseline)",title = "Activity change in maps usage for driving while observing the number of social distancing measures in Brazil.",subtitle = "Drawn from Apple Maps Usage")
grid.arrange(Bdriving.soc,Bdriving.date.soc)
```





## Argentina


## Mexico
(same pattern like Brazil just skipped now)



## Canada

1.Daily confirmed cases and daily deaths in Canada.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
plotCconfirmed.date <- {Canada%>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = daily_confirmed))} + geom_point()+labs(x="Date" ,y="Daily Confirmed Cases" ,title = "Daily Confirmed Cases in Canada")+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months", date_labels = "%b-%y")+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)

plotCdeaths.date <- {Canada%>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = daily_deaths))} + geom_point()+labs(x="Date" ,y="Daily Deaths" ,title = "Daily Deaths in Canada")+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months", date_labels = "%b-%y")+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)

grid.arrange(plotCconfirmed.date,plotCdeaths.date)
```

we have two phases in Canada, so we divide it by two periods.One starts at March 1 and ends at June 30. Another one starts at July 1.

Let's look at the relationship between number of public health measures and frequency that people visit retail and recreation places in Canada.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Canada_phase1 <- filter(Canada, date < "2020-07-1")
Canada_phase2 <- filter(Canada,date>="2020-07-1")

```
