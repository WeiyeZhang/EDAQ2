Variables:
* date, 
* daily_confirmed,
* daily_deaths, 
* soc_dist,
* mov_rest,
* pub_health,
* lockdown,
* gov_soc_econ,
* apple_mtr_driving,
* gcmr_retail_recreation,
* gcmr_workplaces,
* gcmr_residential, 
* gcmr_workplaces



Import all packages and our dataset.

```{r}
library(rio)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(gridExtra)
library(plyr)


CovidData<- import("tidycovid19.csv", setclass="tibble")
CovidData$date = as.Date(parse_date_time(CovidData$date,orders=c("y","ym","ymd")))
```

Write the function for altering the cumulative confirmed cases into daily confirmed cases.

```{r}
firstdiff <- function(x) {
  shifted <- c(0,x[1:(length(x)-1)])
  result = x-shifted
  which_negative = which(result<0)
  result[which_negative] = NA
  return(result)
}


CovidData <- mutate(CovidData, daily_confirmed = firstdiff(confirmed))
CovidData <- mutate(CovidData, daily_deaths = firstdiff(deaths))


```

Selecting two countries in North America, Canada and Mexico, and two countries in South America: Argentina and Brazil. We choose the baseline date as 2020-03-01.

```{r}
BrazilDataPostMar1 <- {CovidData %>% 
    filter ((str_detect(country, "Brazil")) & (date > as.Date("2020-03-01")))}
ArgentinaDataPostMar1 <- {CovidData %>% 
    filter ((str_detect(country, "Argentina")) & (date > as.Date("2020-03-01")))}
CanadaDataPostMar1 <- {CovidData %>% 
    filter ((str_detect(country, "Canada")) & (date > as.Date("2020-03-01")))}
MexicoDataPostMar1 <- {CovidData %>% 
    filter ((str_detect(country, "Mexico")) & (date > as.Date("2020-03-01")))}
```

Then we extract all the variables from our variables list to our data frame.

```{r}
Brazil <- {BrazilDataPostMar1%>% 
    filter(country == "Brazil") %>%
    select(country,date, daily_confirmed,daily_deaths, soc_dist,mov_rest,pub_health,lockdown,gov_soc_econ,apple_mtr_driving,gcmr_retail_recreation,gcmr_workplaces,gcmr_residential, gcmr_workplaces) }

Mexico <-{MexicoDataPostMar1%>% 
    select(country,date, daily_confirmed,daily_deaths, soc_dist,mov_rest,pub_health,lockdown,gov_soc_econ,apple_mtr_driving,gcmr_retail_recreation,gcmr_workplaces,gcmr_residential, gcmr_workplaces) }

Canada<-{CanadaDataPostMar1 %>% 
    select(country,date, daily_confirmed,daily_deaths, soc_dist,mov_rest,pub_health,lockdown,gov_soc_econ,apple_mtr_driving,gcmr_retail_recreation,gcmr_workplaces,gcmr_residential, gcmr_workplaces) }

Argentina<-{ArgentinaDataPostMar1 %>% 
    select(country,date, daily_confirmed,daily_deaths, soc_dist,mov_rest,pub_health,lockdown,gov_soc_econ,apple_mtr_driving,gcmr_retail_recreation,gcmr_workplaces,gcmr_residential, gcmr_workplaces) }
```

We compile the data set of four countries into one data set.

```{r}
Americadata<-rbind.fill(Argentina,Brazil,Canada,Mexico)
```


For Brazil:
1.First look at the relationship daily confirmed cases and daily deaths

```{r}
plotBconfirmed.date <- {Brazil%>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = daily_confirmed))} +geom_smooth(se=FALSE)+ geom_point()+labs(x="Date" ,y="Daily Confirmed Cases" ,title = "Daily Confirmed Cases in Brazil")+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months", date_labels = "%b-%y")

plotBdeaths.date <- {Brazil%>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = daily_deaths))} +geom_smooth(se=FALSE)+ geom_point()+labs(x="Date" ,y="Daily Deaths" ,title = "Daily Deaths in Brazil")+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months", date_labels = "%b-%y")

grid.arrange(plotBconfirmed.date,plotBdeaths.date)
```


2.Relationship between lockdown measures and the frequency that people visit retail and recreation places in Brazil.

```{r}
plotBlockdown.retail<- {Brazil%>% ggplot(aes(x = lockdown,y = gcmr_retail_recreation))} +  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(lockdown, 0.5)))

grid.arrange(plotAconfirmed.date,plotAdeaths.date)
```

2.Relationship between lockdown measures and the frequency that people visit retail and recreation places in Argentina.

```{r}

grid.arrange(plotCconfirmed.date,plotCdeaths.date)
```

we have two phases in Canada, so we divide it by two periods.One starts at March 1 and ends at June 30. Another one starts at July 1.

Let's look at the relationship between number of public health measures and frequency that people visit retail and recreation places in Canada.

```{r}
Canada_phase1 <- filter(Canada, date < "2020-07-1")
Canada_phase2 <- filter(Canada,date>="2020-07-1")

pubheal.retailphase1<-ggplot(Canada_phase1, aes(x=pub_health, y=gcmr_retail_recreation)) + geom_point() + labs(title='Phase 1')


pubheal.retailphase2<-ggplot(Canada_phase2, aes(x=pub_health, y=gcmr_retail_recreation)) + geom_point() + labs(title='Phase 2')
grid.arrange(pubheal.retailphase1,pubheal.retailphase2)
```
2.Relationship between social distancing measures and the frequency that people visit retail and recreation places in Canada.

```{r}
plotCsoc1.retail<- {Canada_phase1%>% ggplot(aes(x =soc_dist,y = gcmr_retail_recreation))} +  geom_boxplot((aes(group = cut_width(soc_dist,0.5))))

plotCsoc2.retail<- {Canada_phase2%>% ggplot(aes(x =soc_dist,y = gcmr_retail_recreation))} +  geom_boxplot((aes(group = cut_width(soc_dist,0.5))))

grid.arrange(plotCsoc1.retail,plotCsoc2.retail)
```
3.Relationship between Number of moving restrictions and the frequency that people visit workplaces in Canada.

```{r}
plotmov1.work<-ggplot(Canada_phase1, aes(x=mov_rest, y=gcmr_workplaces)) +  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(mov_rest,0.5)))+labs(x="Number of moving restrictions",y="Frequency people visit work places%")

plotmov2.work<-ggplot(Canada_phase2, aes(x=mov_rest, y=gcmr_workplaces)) +  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(mov_rest,0.5)))+labs(x="Number of moving restrictions",y="Frequency people visit work places%")

grid.arrange(plotmov1.work,plotmov2.work)

```



Let's have a general overview on four chosen coutries.
1.Number of lockdown measures in the whole period in different countries.

```{r}
Americalockdown<-{Americadata%>%ggplot(aes(x=date,y=lockdown))}+geom_jitter(aes(color=country))
print(Americalockdown)
```
2.Relationship between 
```{r}
Americarecreation <- {Americadata %>% ggplot(aes(x=lockdown,y=gcmr_retail_recreation))}+geom_jitter(aes(color=country))
    
print(Americarecreation)
```

3.We compare the relationship between the number of social distancing measures and the frequency that people visit retail and recreation places in different countries.

```{r}
ggplot(data = Americadata, aes(x=soc_dist,y=gcmr_retail_recreation))+geom_jitter(aes(color=country))
```

Condiser other datasets.

We now have a look into Government Response Index Tracker collected by Oxford University,

```{r}
GovResptracker<- import("OxCGRT_latest.csv",setclass = "tibble")

BrazilGov <- {GovResptracker %>% 
    filter((str_detect(CountryName,"Brazil")) & (Date > as.Date("2020-03-01") & Date <as.Date("2020-09-24")))}

Binternal.retailphase<-ggplot(BrazilGov, aes(x=BrazilGov$`C7_Restrictions on internal movement`, y=Brazil$gcmr_retail_recreation)) + geom_point()
print(Binternal.retailphase)


Bfacial.work<-{BrazilGov %>% ggplot(aes(x=`C8_International travel controls`,y=Brazil$gcmr_retail_recreation))}+geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(`C8_International travel controls`,0.5)))
print(Bfacial.work)
```
