### We now have a look into Government Response Index Tracker collected by Oxford University, the interpretation of the variables is [here](https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/blob/master/documentation/codebook.md)

The variables chosen shows below with definition and coding, each measured in ordinal scale.

### Look at Brazil in detail.

#### 1.Activity change in retail and recreation places.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Bretail.internal<-{BrazilGov %>% ggplot(aes(x=Date,y=Brazil$gcmr_retail_recreation,color=`C6_Stay at home requirements`))}+geom_point()+labs(x="date", y="Activity change in recreation",title = "Recovering of retail and recreation activity ",subtitle = "Observing requirements on staying at home.")+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "3 weeks", date_labels = "%d/%m")

grid.arrange(Bretail.internal,covBretail.internal)
```

#### 2.Activity change in frequency that people visiting the residencial places, given level of requirements on staying at home.

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Bresi.home <- {BrazilGov %>% ggplot(aes(x=Date,y=Brazil$gcmr_residential,color=`C6_Stay at home requirements`))}+geom_point()+scale_x_date(date_breaks = "3 weeks", date_labels = "%d/%m")+labs(y="Activity in residential places (% change from baseline)",title = "Change in activity  in residential places with requirements on staying at home.")

```
```{r,echo=FALSE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
covAmeretail.internal<-{AmericaGov%>% ggplot(aes(x=`C6_Stay at home requirements`,y=Americadata$gcmr_retail_recreation,))}+geom_point()+labs(x="Level of staying at home requirement",y="Activity change in grocery and pharmacy places",title= "Covariation between level9 of moving restrictions and activity change in grocery and pharmacy places in four chosen country")+scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```

####  By the plot below, we observe that public reaction after different level of closing workplaces. The frequency of visiting workplaces sharply decreased after government required closing(or work from home) for all-but-essential workplaces (eg grocery stores, doctors). But in the mid-late people tend to visiting workplaces under level 3 closing policy.

### Covariation between change in activity in grocery and pharmacy places and level of requirements on staying at home.
