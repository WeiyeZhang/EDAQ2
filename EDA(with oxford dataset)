## Introduction
#### We choose four datasets from four countries: Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Mexico from America continent. The datasets "tidycovid19" contains data drawn from Google Mobility Reports, Apple Maps Usage and so on. We want to answer the question that what's the effect of government interventions to companies, for example, OmniCorp which stakes in the retail and hospitality sectors.
\n
#### In the first step, we extract the daily confirmed cases and data and aggregate four countries into one graph to check the scope of the covid-19 pandemic. The trend demonstrates the critical situation in Brazil that daily confirmed cases, and the . But the peak values of each countries occured at different time.

## Canada

#####1.There are two phases in Canada so we divide into phase one and phase two. Phase one started at beginning of Feburary and reached 2,000 cases to one-month period with less than 1,000 daily confirmed cases. Second phase has started around August and it is noticeable that second wave reaches much higher daily confirmed cases.

## Conclusion
#### How we answer the question that what's the effect of the government interventions and what the reasons should be.
